# ReactJs-CodeWithHarry

I have made a word counter using Reactjs. It contains buttons to clear, copy, trim, convert to lowercase and convert to uppercase the text. It has a preview section and another section to calculate the time take to read and number of words in the textfield. The navbar contains home, about, contact, and search fields. The website also has a about us section and a dark mode button.
